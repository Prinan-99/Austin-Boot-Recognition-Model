# Austin-Boot-Recognition-Model
Developed a deep learning model to recognize boots in images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
A deep learning model for boot recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project involves image preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

Features:
âœ… Dataset Preprocessing â€“ Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
âœ… CNN Model Architecture â€“ Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
âœ… Training & Evaluation â€“ Accuracy/loss curves, confusion matrix analysis.
âœ… Visualizations â€“ Graphs to interpret model performance.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib
ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements: Implement Transfer Learning (ResNet/VGG16) for higher accuracy.
